# Contributing to Baraza.

## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to wobadha@gmail.com .

## What we're working on

Take a look at the issues in our [issues list](https://github.com/Obadha/baraza/issues) to get started!

## How you can get involved

We are currently looking for contributions in the following areas:
1. Product Refinement - We are looking to clearly refine and define the flow of the baraza android application.
2. Application Designer - We are looking for a graphic designer to join us and help come up with practical wireframes from the product requirements. 
3. Application Developer - We hope we can get to have a working prototype at the end of the sprint. We would love to have three, maybe four android developers come in and transform the wireframes into a working prototype. The application will be a native android application built with java using android studio.
4. Documentation - Right now, what is seen here is all the documentation available for this application. It would be helpful if we could have this organized into an easier to navigate through documentation.

## How to submit changes

The issues are labeled differently(according to the related branches in the repo) so filter them according to preference and select the most appropriate. The issues are labeled :

**developer** - this contains the code for the baraza android application. If you want to contribute by helping build the application by writing android code, this is where you should be.

**documentation** - this contains documentation for the baraza application, describing the application flow and how the application works. Take a look and see if anything is missing, or if something should be done differently.

**design** - this is where you will find the design of the application, including screen designs . Let us know if you think we should design the application differently, or if you want to help design the icons, help decide the colors, we'll be glad to hear it.
Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository!

## How to report bugs

Ask your contributors to stay on the lookout for can any potential issue that might cause problems for the project. These could be problems in code (if you’re creating software), content omissions or copy errors (if you’re creating a learning resource), or any issues with the functionality or design of your project. 

Most projects invite all contributors to report bugs, so "debugging" or fixing problems happens quickly and with the input of the community. Take a look at [Atom's example](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs) for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.
